# Fix Review Findings from LLM Proxy Rename (3dbaf30)

## Overview
Address critical and warning-level issues found during code review of the `openai` → `llm` proxy setting rename commit.

## Context
- Commit reviewed: 3dbaf30 ("feat: rename proxy setting from openai to llm for provider-agnostic naming")
- Files involved: `docs/openapi.yaml`, `agent-worker/package.json`, `internal/database/models.go`
- Related patterns: existing migration patterns in `internal/database/`

## Development Approach
- **Testing approach**: Regular (code first, then tests)
- Complete each task fully before moving to the next
- **CRITICAL: every task MUST include new/updated tests**
- **CRITICAL: all tests must pass before starting next task**

## Implementation Steps

### Task 1: Fix OpenAPI spec - rename openai to llm

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/openapi.yaml`

- [ ] Search `docs/openapi.yaml` for remaining `openai` references in the proxy settings schema
- [ ] Rename the service key from `openai` to `llm` to match the new DB/API field names
- [ ] Verify the schema matches the Go struct and frontend types
- [ ] Run `make verify` - must pass before task 2

### Task 2: Add undici as explicit dependency

**Files:**
- Modify: `agent-worker/package.json`

- [ ] Check the version of `undici` currently resolved in `node_modules`
- [ ] Add `undici` to `dependencies` in `agent-worker/package.json` with a compatible version range
- [ ] Run `npm install` in `agent-worker/` to update the lockfile
- [ ] Verify existing agent-worker tests still pass: `make test-agent`
- [ ] Run `make verify` - must pass before task 3

### Task 3: Make database migration transactional

**Files:**
- Modify: `internal/database/models.go` (or wherever the migration lives)

- [ ] Find the migration that copies `openai_enabled` → `llm_enabled` and drops the old column
- [ ] Wrap the UPDATE + DROP COLUMN in a database transaction
- [ ] Change the data-copy warning log to return an error on failure (fail loudly)
- [ ] Write a test verifying the migration handles partial failure gracefully
- [ ] Run `make test` - must pass before task 4

### Task 4: Verify acceptance criteria

- [ ] Manual test: save LLM proxy settings via the API using the new field name, confirm they persist correctly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `make test-all`
- [ ] Run linter: `golangci-lint run`
- [ ] Verify test coverage meets 80%+

### Task 5: Update documentation

- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if internal patterns changed
- [ ] Move this plan to `docs/plans/completed/`
